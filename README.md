# AggieforsensePharmaceutical
I am Huang Weijie, and I really want to become an e-commerce operator for Sanse Pharmaceutical. Here are the five reasons why I think I can:

Relevant experience in e-commerce platforms: I have worked as a merchant operator in the TikTok e-commerce department before. Compared to other applicants, I am more sensitive to the interests of the platform, and I can communicate better with the platform. I also have a certain market insight and forecasting ability, which enables me to quickly grasp market trends, develop marketing strategies, and adjust marketing strategies based on market changes.
Passion for e-commerce operations: I like changes and learning new things. E-commerce operations are positions that are fast-paced and require quick iterations. By doing this job, I can achieve a sense of accomplishment.
Digital marketing capabilities: I should have certain digital marketing capabilities, including the analysis, collection, and utilization of data from e-commerce channels, as well as the formulation and implementation of corresponding digital marketing strategies.
Proficient in using various AI tools: I am curious about AI tools and actively explore them. I have now integrated ChatGPT and MidJourney into my workflow. There are many tedious tasks in e-commerce operations that AI can help me with, thereby improving efficiency.
Broad vision: I am willing to explore the gameplay of foreign digital marketing to open up my operational vision and innovate new operational methods.
